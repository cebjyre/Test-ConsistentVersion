Test-ConsistentVersion version 0.2.3

The purpose of this module is to make it easy for other distribution
authors to have consistent version numbers within the modules (and
changelog and readme) of the distribution.

I recommend using Dist-Zilla with the PkgVersion, PodVersion (or
PodWeaver) and NextRelease plugins as a more elegant and simple
approach than this module (handling the numbering automatically,
rather than informing you of what needs to be fixed); however I
do still plan to fix bugs that may arise.
